## AdfreeTube

We've all wanted a way to share youtube URL's without those damned ads.  All examples thus far that I've tried, this solution seems to work by merely embedding it (I think).  But now you can append a video URL to my website or give it a video to play.

#### Examples:

From the URL:
http://brandonminton.com/youtube/?url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPsG8td7C5k

From the input:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPsG8td7C5k

#### Bonus:
The video will resize with the browser.
